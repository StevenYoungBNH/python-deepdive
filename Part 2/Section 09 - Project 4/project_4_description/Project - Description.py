# ### Project

# For this project you have 4 files containing information about persons.
# 
# The files are:
# * `personal_info.csv` -   personal information such as name, gender, etc. (one row per person)
# * `vehicles.csv` -   what vehicle people own (one row per person)
# * `employment.csv` -   where a person is employed (one row per person)
# * `update_status.csv` -   when the person's data was created and last updated
# 
# Each file contains a key, `SSN`, which **uniquely** identifies a person.
# 
# This key is present in **all** four files.
# 
# You are guaranteed that the same SSN value is present in **every** file, and that it only appears **once per file**.
# 
# In addition, the files are all sorted by SSN, i.e. the SSN values appear in the same order in each file.

# ##### Goal 1
# 
# Your first task is to create iterators for each of the four files that contained cleaned up data, of the correct type (e.g. string, int, date, etc), and represented by a named tuple.
# 
# For now these four iterators are just separate, independent iterators.

# ##### Goal 2
# 
# Create a single iterable that combines all the columns from all the iterators.
# 
# The iterable should yield named tuples containing all the columns.
# Make sure that the SSN's across the files match!
# 
# All the files are guaranteed to be in SSN sort order, and every SSN is unique, and every SSN appears in every file.
# 
# Make sure the SSN is not repeated 4 times - one time per row is enough!

# ##### Goal 3
# 
# Next, you want to identify any stale records, where stale simply means the record has not been updated since 3/1/2017 (e.g. last update date < 3/1/2017). Create an iterator that only contains current records (i.e. not stale) based on the `last_updated` field from the `status_update` file.

# ##### Goal 4
# 
# Find the largest group of car makes for each gender.
# 
# Possibly more than one such group per gender exists (equal sizes).

# #### Hints

# You will not be able to use a simple split approach here, as I explain in the video.
# 
# Instead you should use the `csv` module and the `reader` function.
# 
# Here's a simple example of how to use it - you will need to expand on this for your project goals, but this is a good starting point.

# In[1]:


import csv

def read_file(file_name):
    with open(file_name) as f:
        rows = csv.reader(f, delimiter=',', quotechar='"')
        yield from rows
    


# In[2]:


from itertools import islice

rows = read_file('personal_info.csv')
for row in islice(rows, 5):
    print(row)


# As you can see, the data is already separated into a list containing the individual fields - but of course they are all just strings.

# ### Good luck!
